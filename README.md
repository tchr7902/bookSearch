# Book Search Engine

## Description

This is an application that allows the user to sign up for an account, log into that account, and search for books using an API. Those search results are then populated, and the user can see a description, picture, and information about the book, as well as preview and save a book. I built this problem to practice my understanding and appliation of MERN.

## Installation and Usage

## Credits

## Future Development
